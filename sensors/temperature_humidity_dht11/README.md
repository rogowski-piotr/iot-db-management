# <p align="center"> ðŸ’§ðŸŒ¡ Measurements of temperature and humidity ðŸ’§ðŸŒ¡ </p>
<p align="justify">
This code allows to measure temperature and humidity and share data via network using ESP8266 and DHT11 sensor.
Measurement will be executed every time when any device connects with them by the TCP port.
After successful measurement, the data will be sent as a response in JSON format.
The system contains automatic detection of sensor availability in case of a measurement fail.
Included to the response flag 'active' informs about correctness of sensor work.

<br/>
<br/>

## âœ‰ Communication âœ‰
1. Connect on device address and specific TCP port 
2. Handle the response
response example:
```json
{
  "sensor": "DHT11",
  "active": true,
  "temperature": 25.5,
  "humidity": 50
}
```

2. Connect to local network by changing this part of the code:

```cpp
const char* ssid = " **here ";
const char* password = " **here";
```
